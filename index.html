To the one I wished for,

Hey baeeee! First and foremost, I am glad that a lot of us are here for you on your special day. Although it may not be done in person, I can't wait to finally be there and enjoy with you. It's quite funny, because everytime I see B99, Lara Raj, SpongeBob or even listen to Kali Uchis, Childish Gambino, and those good Bruno Mars songs, I remember you. Even up to the orange lid peanut butter and the malunggay buns or to the Mang Inasal store I always pass by when I get home, I remember you. Maybe its my separation anxiety talking or the fact that I have gotten so used to be with you for 9 hours that your entire presence has long been engraved in my consciousness. But I miss you, a loooooot. I saw this video wherein a guy was talking about how we should never let go of that person who figures us from in and out, that alone made me think of you. All throughout my life, I only wished for a few things. There were for my academics, career, family. But that one thing I sincerely wish for the most was to have someone to truly know me, see me, and still be with me even if I am not what I seem to be. I realized, it took me 18 years to finally found you. Even if it quite sucked to not know you that sooner, I figured it was just the right time. Because you are worth the wait bae. You will always be. It was our friendship that I am most thankful for and the heaven knows I ain't gonna let go of you ever haha. Through our highs and lows especially this summer, I am and will eternally be grateful I am with you during those times. I sincerely hope you know how much your presence impacted my life from here on out. Or how much I always read those letters you sent me everytime I feel the world was taking out its wrath on me. It seems I also cling to such nostalgia too. But rather than just clinging to those good old days, I'd prefer making new memorable ones with you. Because just as how you are there for me, I am and will always be there for you. Because just as how much you see right through me, I also see right through yourself too. I have never known someone to ever see me for who I am, more than you do. And if multiverse exist, I always know I am going to look for you, even on the different versions of yourself. Our friendship may not be perfect at all times, but I hope you do know when things get rough, I would never give up on you. Not now, not ever. Because as you just said, if loving is a choice, I would certainly choose you. After all, you are Rosalie Clare Cuer Belonguel. The one I wished for. Happie.st birthday to you bae! Cheers to more special days to come!

With much love and care,
August Laine
